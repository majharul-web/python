### 🕒 Time Complexity

Time complexity measures **how the number of operations grows** as the input size (`n`) increases.  
It doesn't refer to actual execution time but rather to the **number of steps an algorithm takes**.

We use **Big O notation** to express time complexity:

- `O(1)` – Constant time
- `O(log n)` – Logarithmic time
- `O(n)` – Linear time
- `O(n log n)` – Linearithmic time
- `O(n²)` – Quadratic time
- `O(√n)` – Square root time
- `O(2ⁿ)` – Exponential time
- `O(n!)` – Factorial time
- `O(nᵏ)` – Polynomial time (where `k` is a constant)
- `O(n^3)` – Cubic time
- `O(n^4)` – Quartic time
