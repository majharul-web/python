### 🕒 Time Complexity

Time complexity is a way to measure how much time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input (usually written as n).  
It doesn't refer to actual execution time but rather to the **number of steps an algorithm takes**.

We use **Big O notation** to express time complexity:

- `O(1)` – Constant time
- `O(log n)` – Logarithmic time
- `O(n)` – Linear time
- `O(n log n)` – Linearithmic time
- `O(n²)` – Quadratic time
- `O(√n)` – Square root time
- `O(2ⁿ)` – Exponential time
- `O(n!)` – Factorial time
- `O(nᵏ)` – Polynomial time (where `k` is a constant)
- `O(n^3)` – Cubic time
- `O(n^4)` – Quartic time
