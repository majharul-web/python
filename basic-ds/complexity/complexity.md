## What is Time Complexity?

Answer: Time complexity is a way to measure how much time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input (usually written as n).
It's depend on number of operation,not execution time.
We express it using Big O notation, like:

-O(1) → constant time
-O(log n) → logarithmic time
-O(n) → linear time
-O(n log n) → linearithmic time
-O(n^2) → quadratic time
-O(2^n) → exponential time
-O(n!) → factorial time
-O(n^k) → polynomial time
