""" 
Inheritance and Composition are two key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that help in organizing code and defining relationships between classes. Hereâ€™s a comparison of both:

1. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (called a subclass or child class) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (called a superclass or parent class). It models a "is-a" relationship between the parent and child classes.

Key Points:
"is-a" Relationship: A subclass is a specialized version of a parent class.

Reusability: The subclass can reuse methods and properties of the parent class.

Extensibility: You can add more specific behavior in the child class that is not present in the parent.

Tight Coupling: Subclasses are tightly coupled with their parent classes. Changes in the parent class can affect the subclasses.



2. Composition
Composition is a design principle where one class is composed of other classes (objects) as attributes. It models a "has-a" relationship. Rather than inheriting from a class, you include instances of other classes inside a class to compose complex behavior.

Key Points:
"has-a" Relationship: A class has objects of other classes as attributes.

Flexibility: The objects can change dynamically and are independent of the composed class.

Loose Coupling: It creates a more flexible and loosely coupled system, as changes to the component classes do not necessarily affect the class that contains them.

Reusability: Components (like CPU, RAM, Storage) can be reused across different classes, not just one class.
